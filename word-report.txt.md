    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Feature extraction
    hog_features = extract_hog(gray)
    histogram_features = extract_histogram(gray)
    statistical_features = extract_statistical(gray)
    
    # Feature combination
    return np.concatenate([
        hog_features,
        histogram_features,
        statistical_features
    ])
```

#### 3.1.2 Classification System
```python
def create_ensemble():
    # SVM Classifier

    # Neural Network
    mlp = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(200, 100))
    
    # Ensemble creation
    return VotingClassifier([
        ('svm', svm),
        ('mlp', mlp)
    ])
